## 🎯 Problem Statement

With the increasing use of social media among students, it's essential to understand how various platforms influence their well-being. This includes academic performance, mental health, sleep duration, and relationship conflicts. This SQL project aims to uncover patterns that help identify high-risk students and provide actionable insights.

---

## 📌 Objectives

1. Analyze usage patterns across demographics (age, gender, country, academic level).
2. Measure relationships between usage time, addiction scores, and mental health.
3. Identify students at risk due to high usage or conflicts.
4. Compare behaviors by platform (e.g., YouTube, Instagram, TikTok).
5. Help stakeholders (educators, counselors) take informed action.
